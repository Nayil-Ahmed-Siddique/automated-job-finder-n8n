🚀 Automated Job Finder – Email Alerts (n8n)

An end-to-end automation workflow built with n8n that aggregates software engineering job postings from multiple sources, filters them intelligently, scores job quality, and delivers curated job alerts via email.
This project demonstrates real-world automation design, not toy examples.

🔍 What This Project Does

Fetches job postings from multiple RSS job sources
Merges and normalizes incoming data
Filters jobs based on:
Software / engineering roles
Country or location criteria
Applies custom job quality scoring using JavaScript
Sends structured email alerts with relevant job links
Designed to scale by simply adding more RSS feeds

This workflow demonstrates:
Practical automation design (not scripts)
Data ingestion from multiple sources
Conditional logic and branching
Custom business logic using JavaScript nodes
Clean separation of concerns
Production-ready thinking using schedulers and filters
