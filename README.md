# 🚀 Automated Job Finder – Email Alerts (n8n)

An end-to-end automation workflow built with **n8n** that aggregates software engineering job postings from multiple sources, filters them intelligently, scores job quality, and delivers curated job alerts via email.

This project demonstrates **real-world automation design**, not toy examples.

---

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Fetches job postings from multiple RSS job sources  
- Merges and normalizes incoming job data  
- Filters jobs based on:
  - Software / engineering roles  
  - Country or location criteria  
- Applies custom job quality scoring using JavaScript  
- Generates structured email alerts with relevant job links  
- Designed to scale easily by adding more RSS feeds  

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

This workflow demonstrates:

- Practical automation design (not scripts)
- Data ingestion from multiple external sources
- Conditional logic and branching
- Custom business logic using JavaScript code nodes
- Clean separation of concerns
- Production-ready thinking using schedulers and filters

Built to show how **automation can replace repetitive manual job searching**.

## 🤖 AI Integration (Mocked)

The workflow includes an AI summarization step designed to integrate with Large Language Model (LLM) APIs such as OpenAI.

For demonstration purposes, a **mock AI node** is used to simulate job description summarization.  
This mock can be seamlessly replaced with a real LLM API call without changing the overall workflow structure.
